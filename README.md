## Disclaimers

- This program requires low-level access to some of your computer hardware to
  apply settings. While no issues should arise from this, **I (Sparronator9999)**
  **and any other contributers shall not be held responsible if this program**
  **fries your computer.**
- Additionally, if you do something silly with the program like turn off all
  your fans while running under full load, **we *will not* be held responsible**
  **for *any* damage you cause to your own hardware from your use of this program.**
- Linux is not yet supported. Please don't beg me for Linux support, it will
  come when I can be bothered (and when I figure out how to run background
  services/daemons on Linux).
- This program, repository and its authors are not affiliated with Micro-Star
  International Co., Ltd. in any way, shape, or form.

## Features

- **Fan control:** Change the fan profiles for your CPU and GPU fans, including
  fan speeds, temperature thresholds, and Full Blast (a.k.a. Cooler Boost in
  MSI Center). This allows you to fix a fan profile that isn't aggressive enough
  under full load, turn your fans off when your computer is idle, or just give
  them a boost during CPU-heavy tasks.
- **Performance mode:** MSI laptops have their own performance mode setting
  (not to be confused with Windows' built-in power plans). You can change it here.
- **Charging threshold:** This program can limit how much your laptop's battery
  charges to, which can help reduce battery degradation, especially if you
  leave your laptop plugged in all the time.
- **Lightweight:** YAMDCC takes up less than two megabytes of disk space when
  installed, and is designed to be light on your laptop's CPU.
- **Configurable:** Almost all settings (including those not accessible through
  the config editor) can be changed with the power of XML.

## Supported Laptops

Currently, there are configs for the following laptops:

  - MSI Alpha 17 C7VF (thanks @SethCodingInc)
  - MSI Bravo 15 B7ED (thanks @VisionCrizzal)
  - MSI Bravo 17 C7VE (thanks @advait404)
  - MSI Crosshair 17 B12UGZ (thanks @ios7jbpro)
  - MSI GF63 Thin 11SC
  - MSI Katana GF66 12UG (thanks @porkmanager)
  - MSI Modern 15 A5M (thanks @tedomi2705)
  - MSI Stealth GS76 11UG (thanks @gemSquared)
  - MSI Titan GT77HX 13VH (thanks @noteMASTER11)

There are also generic configs that should work with most MSI laptops, but with
an incorrect default config. You can use the EC-to-config feature to get the
proper fan profiles for your laptop, then [create a pull request](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/pulls)
to get your laptop's config added to the project.

Other laptop brands are not officially supported. You can still try and
[make your own config](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/wiki/How-to-make-a-config-for-YAMDCC#manually-from-scratch),
but chances are you're looking for [NoteBook FanControl](https://github.com/UraniumDonut/nbfc-revive) instead.

### Community-tested laptops

The following laptops have been tested by the community and are confirmed to be
working, but don't have their own public YAMDCC configs. A suggested generic
config is provided below:

- MSI Raider GE66 12UGS (thanks @grimy400): `MSI-10th-gen-or-newer-dualfan.xml`
- MSI Vector 17 HX A14VHG (thanks @injitools): `MSI-10th-gen-or-newer-dualfan-nokeylight.xml`
- MSI Vector GP78 HX 13V (thanks @Twisted6): `MSI-10th-gen-or-newer-dualfan.xml`

To test your laptop, go to the [config tutorial](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/wiki/How-to-make-a-config-for-YAMDCC)
wiki page and follow the instructions to get a config for your laptop.

1: Support for this feature depends on the specific MSI laptop model and YAMDCC
support.

2: As of v2.0.38, MSI Center takes about 950 MB of storage space when counting
the UWP app (749 MB) and the files installed on first launch to
`C:\Program Files (x86)\MSI` (205 MB). YAMDCC's installed size is based on the
Release build of [v1.0](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/releases/tag/v1.0.0),
and includes all unzipped program files and included config XMLs.

3: MSI Center only supports setting the charge threshold to 60%, 80%, or 100%,
while YAMDCC can set this to anything between 0 and 100% (with 0 meaning charge
to 100% always).

4: YAMDCC only supports monitoring the CPU/GPU temperatures and fan speeds via EC.

## Roadmap

### v1.1

The following features are planned for v1.1:

- [x] Hotkey support ([#22](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/issues/22))
  - This will be a separate background program that stays in the system tray
    and listens to keyboard shortcuts.

Betas will be released soon after this README is updated. You can download them
from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/releases),
or by enabling download of pre-release versions in the YAMDCC updater.

### Future releases

Below are some planned features for potential future releases:

- [ ] CLI support
  - Development of a CLI application for YAMDCC has started, but isn't publicly
    available yet
    - The CLI is missing a *lot* of features, and could do with a rewrite.
- [ ] Re-work setup experience
  - Currently the Config Editor handles managing service installation, but this
    should probably be done in an installer/separate application.
  - All MSI laptops appear to have one of two EC configurations. In the future,
    I plan to first ask which generation of laptop they have (10th-gen Intel or
    later, or 9th-gen Intel or older), then implement auto-detection of laptop
    generation in the future once I figure out when laptops with AMD chips
    started using the "2nd-gen" EC layout.
- [ ] Plugin system for additional optional features *(needs research)*
- [ ] Support for keyboard mic/speaker mute LEDs
  - Apparently this isn't handled by hardware/Windows, but after
    [reverse-engineering Apple's Boot Camp](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/OpenBootCamp)
    to get keyboard shortcuts working without it, I really shouldn't be
    surprised anymore.
- [ ] GPU switch support
  - Research for this feature has stalled. Since my laptop doesn't appear to
    support this feature, this may be removed from the planned features in the
    future unless someone else figures out how to control the GPU switch
    without MSI Center/Feature Manager.
- [ ] .NET support
  - Mandatory for Linux support
  - The GUI *should* compile on .NET 8 (and in fact *has* been compiled on .NET 8 before).
  - The Windows service on the other hand... is going to be interesting. Even
    with the `Microsoft.Windows.Compatibility` package installed, I still
    wasn't able to get the service to run without issues.
- [ ] Linux support *(not guaranteed)*
  - Now this would require some figuring out, and may end up being a seperate
    project that's compatible with this project's configs.

## Download

Beta builds are available from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/releases).

Development builds are available through [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/actions).

If you don't have a GitHub account, you can also download the latest development build from
[nightly.link](https://nightly.link/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/workflows/build/main?preview).

You're probably looking for the `Release` build, unless you're debugging issues with the program.

Alternatively, you can [build the program yourself](#compile).

## Compile

See also the [wiki page](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/wiki/Building).

### Using Visual Studio

1.  Install Visual Studio 2022 with the `.NET Desktop Development` workload checked.
2.  Download the code repository, or clone it with `git`.
3.  Extract the downloaded code, if needed.
4.  Open `YAMDCC.sln` in Visual Studio.
5.  Click `Build` > `Build Solution` to build everything.
6.  Your output, assuming default build settings, is located in `YAMDCC.ConfigEditor\bin\Debug\net48\`.
7.  ???
8.  Profit!

Make sure to only use matching `yamdccsvc.exe` and `ConfigEditor.exe` together,
otherwise you may encounter issues (that means `net stop yamdccsvc` first, then
compile).

### From the command line

1.  Follow steps 1-3 above to install Visual Studio and download the code.
2.  Open `Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022` and `cd` to your project directory.
3.  Run `msbuild /t:restore` to restore the solution, including NuGet packages.
4.  Run `msbuild YAMDCC.sln /p:platform="Any CPU" /p:configuration="Debug"` to
    build the project, substituting `Debug` with `Release` if you want a
    release build instead.
5.  Your output should be located in `YAMDCC.ConfigEditor\bin\Debug\net48\`,
    assuming you built with the above unmodified command.
6.  ???
7.  Profit!
