## Disclaimers

- This program requires low-level access to some of your computer hardware to apply settings. While
  no issues should arise from this, **I (Sparronator9999) and any other contributers**
  **shall not be held responsible if this program fries your computer.**
- Additionally, if you do something silly with the program like turn off all your fans while
  running under full load, **we *will not* be held responsible for *any* damage you cause to your**
  **own hardware from your use of this program.**
- Linux is not yet supported. Please don't beg me for Linux support, it will come when I can be
  bothered (and when I figure out how to run background services/daemons on Linux).
- This program, repository and its authors are not affiliated with Micro-Star International Co., Ltd. in any way, shape, or form.

## Features

- **Fan control:** Change the fan curves for your CPU and GPU fans, including fan speeds,
  temperature thresholds, and Full Blast (a.k.a. Cooler Boost in MSI Center). This allows you to
  fix a curve that is not aggressive enough under full load, or to turn your fans off when your
  computer is idle.
- **Performance mode:** MSI laptops have their own performance mode setting (not to be confused
  with Windows' built-in power plans). You can change it here.
- **Charging threshold:** This program can limit how much your laptop's battery charges to, which
  can help reduce battery degradation, especially if you leave your laptop plugged in all the time.
- **Lightweight:** YAMDCC takes up less than two megabytes of disk space when installed, and is
  designed to be light on your laptop's CPU.
- **Configurable:** Almost all settings (including those not accessible through the config editor)
  can be changed with the power of XML.

## Supported Laptops

Currently, there are configs for the following laptops:

  - MSI GF63 Thin 11SC
  - MSI Modern 15 A5M (thanks @tedomi2705)
  - MSI Katana GF66 12UG (thanks @porkmanager)
  - MSI Crosshair 17 B12UGZ (thanks @ios7jbpro)
  - MSI Titan GT77HX 13VH (thanks @noteMASTER11)

There are also generic configs that should work with most MSI laptops, but with an incorrect default
config. You can use the EC-to-config feature to get the proper fan curves for your laptop, then
[create a pull request](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/pulls) to get your laptop's
config added to the project.

Other laptop brands are not officially supported. You can still try and
[make your own config](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/wiki/How-to-make-a-config-for-YAMDCC#manually-from-scratch),
but chances are you're looking for [NoteBook FanControl](https://github.com/UraniumDonut/nbfc-revive) instead.

### Community-tested laptops

The following laptops have been tested by the community and are confirmed to be working, but don't
have their own public YAMDCC configs. A suggested generic config is provided below:

- MSI Vector GP78 HX 13V (thanks @Twisted6): `MSI-10th-gen-or-newer-dualfan.xml`
- MSI Raider GE66 12UGS (thanks @grimy400): `MSI-10th-gen-or-newer-dualfan.xml`
- MSI Vector 17 HX A14VHG (thanks @injitools): `MSI-10th-gen-or-newer-dualfan-nokeylight.xml`

To test your laptop, go to the [config tutorial](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/wiki/How-to-make-a-config-for-YAMDCC)
wiki page and follow the instructions to get a config for your laptop.

1: Support for this feature depends on the specific MSI laptop model and YAMDCC support.

2: As of v2.0.38, MSI Center takes about 950 MB of storage space when counting the UWP app (749 MB)
and the files installed on first launch to `C:\Program Files (x86)\MSI` (205 MB). YAMDCC's installed
size is based on the Release build of [v1.0 Beta 7](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.7),
and includes all unzipped program files and included config XMLs.

3: MSI Center only supports setting the charge threshold to 60%, 80%, or 100%, while YAMDCC can set
this to anything between 0 and 100% (with 0 meaning charge to 100% always).

4: YAMDCC only supports monitoring the CPU/GPU temperatures and fan speeds via EC.

## Roadmap

Below are some changes I would like to make before a 1.0 release of YAMDCC:

- [ ] Fix any remaining bugs before the 1.0 release.
  - Beta releases are currently available for v1.0. Please download them from
    [Releases](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/releases) and report any problems to
    [the issue tracker](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/issues)

The following features are currently planned for v1.1:

- [ ] Hotkey support (requested by @grimy400)
  - This will most likely be implemented as a separate background program that listens to keyboard shortcuts,
    since Windows services (or at least those running as Local System) can't "see" keyboard input.
- [ ] Switch fan profiles on performance mode setting adjustment ([#37](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/issues/37))

Below are some planned features for potential future releases:

- [ ] CLI support
  - Development of a CLI application for YAMDCC has started, but isn't publicly available yet
    - The CLI is missing a *lot* of features, and could do with a rewrite.
- [ ] Support for editing laptop config registers using the GUI/CLI
  - This would allow for creating configs for other laptop brands from the config UI
  - Currently, the only way to do this is to edit the XML directly or use the EC-to-config feature.
- [ ] Plugin system for additional optional features *(needs research)*
- [ ] .NET support
  - Mandatory for Linux support
  - The GUI *should* compile on .NET 8 (and in fact *has* been compiled on .NET 8 before).
  - The Windows service on the other hand... is going to be interesting. Even
    with the `Microsoft.Windows.Compatibility` package installed, I still
    wasn't able to get the service to run without issues.
- [ ] Linux support *(not guaranteed)*
  - Now this would require some figuring out, and may end up being a seperate
    project that's compatible with this project's configs.

## Download

Beta builds are available from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/releases).

Development builds are available through [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/actions).

If you don't have a GitHub account, you can also download the latest development build from
[nightly.link](https://nightly.link/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/workflows/build/main?preview).

You're probably looking for the `Release` build, unless you're debugging issues with the program.

Alternatively, you can [build the program yourself](#compile).

## Compile

See also the [wiki page](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/wiki/Building).

### Using Visual Studio

1.  Install Visual Studio 2022 with the `.NET Desktop Development` workload checked.
2.  Download the code repository, or clone it with `git`.
3.  Extract the downloaded code, if needed.
4.  Open `YAMDCC.sln` in Visual Studio.
5.  Click `Build` > `Build Solution` to build everything.
6.  Your output, assuming default build settings, is located in `YAMDCC.GUI\bin\Debug\net48\`.
7.  ???
8.  Profit!

Make sure to only use matching `yamdccsvc.exe` and `YAMDCC.exe` together, otherwise you
may encounter issues (that means `net stop yamdccsvc` first, then compile).

### From the command line

1.  Follow steps 1-3 above to install Visual Studio and download the code.
2.  Open `Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022` and `cd` to your project directory.
3.  Run `msbuild /t:restore` to restore the solution, including NuGet packages.
4.  Run `msbuild YAMDCC.sln /p:platform="Any CPU" /p:configuration="Debug"` to build
    the project, substituting `Debug` with `Release` (or `Any CPU` with `x86` or `x64`)
    if you want a release build instead.
5.  Your output should be located in `YAMDCC.GUI\bin\Debug\net48\`, assuming you built
    with the above unmodified command.
6.  ???
7.  Profit!

## Issues

If your question isn't already answered in the [FAQ](#faq) or [issues megathread](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/issues/1),
and there isn't already another similar issue in [the issue tracker](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/issues),
feel free to open an issue. Please make sure to use the correct issue template for your problem.

## Contributing

See the [compile instructions](#compile) to build this project.

If you would like to contribute to the project with bug fixes, new features,
or new configs, feel free to open a pull request. Please include the following:

- **Bug fixes/improvements/new feature:** Describe the changes you made and why they
  are important or useful.
- **New config:** Add a config with your laptop's default fan profile so that
  other people don't have to run the EC-to-config tool.
